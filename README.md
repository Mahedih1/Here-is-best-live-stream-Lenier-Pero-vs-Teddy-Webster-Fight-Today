Fight Preview and Human Story: Lenier Pero vs Teddy Webster
American battler Teddy “Detrailous” Webster meets Cuba’s undefeated Lenier Pero in a heavyweight showdown at the Caribe Royale Orlando in Florida on April 18, 2025. This fight, being streamed around the world on DAZN, is more than a clash of fists — it’s a clash of backgrounds, aspirations and fighting philosophies.
The Cuban Southpaw on the Rise: Lenier Pero
Fighting from a target on his back (he has been deemed the "El Justiciero"), Lenier Pero, with a perfect record of 11-0-0 (8 KOs), a 73% KO rate. The southpaw Pero, 24, is 6'4" (194 cm) tall with a 79" reach, and his technical skill and power traces back to Cuba’s vaunted amateur program. His path started when he was 9 and inspired by Cuban greats like Teofilo Stevenson and Felix Savon. Pero’s amateur credentials are of a world class level: gold medals at the 2010 Youth Olympics, 2011 and 2015 Pan American Games and an Olympic quarterfinal berth in 2016. He was 20 when he turned pro in 2019 and soon won the WBA Fedelatin heavyweight title. His latest hot streak features a TKO victory over Viktor Vykhryst, and if nothing else, Mendez has shown that he can wear down even elite fighters with body work. Pero’s story is one of discipline, of family and of national pride. “I wanted to make a name for myself, my own name, and be a big name in Cuba,” he says, the ambition that’s made him WBA’s No. 5 heavyweight.
Teddy Webster: The Underdog with Grit
At 36, Teddy “Detrailous” Webster comes with a different kind of battle. At 6'0" (183 cm) and 250 lbs, Webster is a no-nonsense fighter whose career path has meandered through local boxing, this art of MMAMMA, and even bare knuckle action. His official pro boxing record is 6-4 (9-4 with 5 KOs per some sources) and he’s noted for taking tough fights on the road, and against top prospects in recent bouts. Webster’s journey has not been quite so simple. He’s surmounted a troubled youth and earned redemption through backyard brawls that instead of ending up behind bars led to legitimate boxing opportunities. “The only way you can truly avoid losing is if you never try, but by doing that you lose the chance to achieve something epic,” says Webster, capturing the underdog. He has grappled in venues large and small, often as the outlier, and now has his biggest stage so far in Pero. Not favored by bookmakers (he’s a 13.10 underdog to Pero’s 1.01 favorite), Webster’s grit and willingness to take on anyone, anywhere has earned him respect.
Pero’s advantages in size, reach, amateur pedigree and knockout power are apparent. But Webster brings heart, experience in multiple combat sports, and a desire to test himself against the best.
